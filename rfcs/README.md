# Frictionless RFCs

## What is an RFC?

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for improvements to our products and processes.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the tech lead team and the community.

## The RFC life-cycle

An RFC goes through the following stages:

- **Pending:** when the RFC is submitted as a PR.
- **Active:** when an RFC PR is merged and undergoing implementation.
- **Landed:** when an RFC's proposed changes are shipped in an actual release.
- **Rejected:** when an RFC PR is closed without being merged.

## When to follow this process

We recommend following this process if you intend to make "substantial" changes to one of our products or processes.

What constitutes a "substantial" change is evolving based on community norms, but may include the following:

- A new product or process
- A major new feature in a product or process
- Changing or removing a major product or process

## Why do you need to do this

It is great that you are considering suggesting new features or changes to Frictionless - we appreciate your willingness to contribute!

And we want to strike a balance between stability and innovation ðŸ˜„

We want newcomers (and the experienced) to propose improvements. At the same time, the constraints and tradeoffs involved may not be immediately obvious to those are proposing a change just to solve a specific problem they just ran into. The RFC process serves as a way to guide you through our thought process when making changes to Frictionless, so that we can be on the same page when discussing why or why not these changes should be made.

## Gathering feedback before submitting

It's often helpful to get feedback on your concept before diving into the level of design detail required for an RFC. **You may open an issue on this repo to start a high-level discussion**, with the goal of eventually formulating an RFC pull request with the specific implementation design.

## What the process is

In short, to get a major improvement added to Datopiain, one must first get the RFC merged into the RFC repo as a markdown file. At that point the RFC is 'active' and may be implemented.

* Fork this RFC repo
* Copy `rfcs/0000-template.md` to `rfcs/0000-my-feature.md` (where 'my-feature' is descriptive. don't assign an RFC number yet).
* Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: **RFCs that do not present convincing motivation, demonstrate understanding of the impact of the design, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or
alternatives tend to be poorly-received**.
* Submit a pull request. As a pull request the RFC will receive design feedback from the larger community, and the author should be prepared to revise it in response.
* Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any comments.
* Eventually, the [tech lead team] will decide whether the RFC is a candidate for inclusion in Vue.
* An RFC can be modified based upon feedback from the [tech lead team] and community. Significant modifications may trigger a new final comment period.
* An RFC may be rejected after public discussion has settled and comments have been made summarizing the rationale for rejection. A member of the [tech lead team] should then close the RFC's associated pull request.
* An RFC may be accepted at the close of its final comment period. A [tech lead team] member will merge the RFC's associated pull request, at which point the RFC will become 'active'.

## Details on Active RFCs

Once an RFC becomes active then authors may implement it and submit the feature as a pull request . Becoming 'active' is not a rubber stamp, and in particular still does not mean the feature will ultimately be merged; it does mean that the tech lead team has agreed to it in principle and are amenable to merging it.

Furthermore, the fact that a given RFC has been accepted and is 'active' implies nothing about what priority is assigned to its implementation, nor whether anybody is currently working on it.

Modifications to active RFC's can be done in followup PR's. We strive to write each RFC in a manner that it will reflect the final design of the feature; but the nature of the process means that we cannot expect every merged RFC to actually reflect what the end result will be at the time of the next major release; therefore we try to keep each RFC document somewhat in sync with the language feature as planned, tracking such changes via followup pull requests to the document.

## Implementing an RFC

The author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it. Of course, the RFC author (like any other developer) is welcome to post an implementation for review after the RFC has been accepted.

An active RFC should have the link to the implementation PR listed if there is one. Feedback to the actual implementation should be conducted in the implementation PR instead of the original RFC PR.

If you are interested in working on the implementation for an 'active' RFC, but cannot determine if someone else is already working on it, feel free to ask (e.g. by leaving a comment on the associated issue).

## Reviewing RFC's

Members of the stewardship team will attempt to review some set of open RFC pull requests on a regular basis. If a tech lead team member believes an RFC PR is ready to be accepted into active status, they can approve the PR using GitHub's review feature to signal their approval of the RFC.

**Frictionless's RFC process owes its inspiration to the [Vue RFC process], [React RFC process] and more**
