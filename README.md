## Where to open issues?

Summary:

* Forum: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/forum/issues the default place for anyone out there to open an issue. It means *one* place for people to do that. Forum is a welcoming place where people can open a first issue, have a look around etc. If those issues are substantive they may move elsewhere ... (e.g. i did that with a spec issue recently). But it's a good landing spot.
  * Also the catch-all for general questions, suggestions, ideas, support requests etc.
* Project: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/project/issues the default place for core team to organize and plan work, schedule sprints etc. NOT for general discussion, ideas, support etc.
* Specs: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/specs/issues
